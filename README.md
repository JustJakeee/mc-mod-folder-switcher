# **Minecraft Mod Folder Switcher**
This is just a little project I made to switch mod folders easier
___
### *How to use*
1. Put all of your mod folders into the `Folders` folder.
![Example](https://i.ibb.co/1RR0FBL/Screenshot-2022-01-26-11-43-05-AM.png)
2. Put the full path of your current mod folder into the config.
```
[config]

mod_folder_path = %APPDATA%/.minecraft/mods
```
3. Run it!
